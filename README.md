# Pentest-Reports
Pentest reports on intentionally exposed networks (CTFs and the like)


Hey Friends!


Feel free to read, refer to, model off these reports. You are welcome to take snippets of the language if it is particularly appealing to you or else if you have no clue where to start with your own journey into reporting.

Please DO NOT submit this report as your own, copy large chunks of text verbatim (like whole sections for example), or use the screenshots included for your own work. You are strongly encouraged to work through these networks on your own as a learning experience and are welcome to use this report as a guide if you get stuck, but keep in mind that humans typically learn things best when suffering is attached to it (AKA, try harder a while).

Overall I am pretty easy about this content, attribution is appreciated but not required, these rules are flexible, I am putting this up to help people learn alongside me and am fine with this content being leveraged in whatever way as long as there are altruistic intentions behind that leveraging. What I am not fine with is any type of usage which spawns from malicious or deceptive intentions (towards myself or any other parties).

If you would like to touch base about anything in particular then please DM me on Twitter: @7RiXxSec



Happy Hacking!
